## Description
This is a small minigame website primarily focused on playing the game Chess. You are able to login/create an account, play games against anyone you specify, and the result is saved to your account. Your elo will be saved and tracked, and you can view a history of games that you have played and that are currently active. We will also be adding smaller minigames such as minesweeper, worldle, snake as mostly a proof of concept. 
## Installation
No installation necessary, can be accessed by url soon. To view the source code you would have to clone the repository. You can run locally after running 'npm i' and 'npm start'. You would have to setup your own local .env files and create a DB to use if running locally 
## Usage
To use, simply access the URL and play. From there there are links to create a chess game, login / logout, view the leaderboards etc.
